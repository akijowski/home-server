# Kube-Prometheus

## Warning

This is a really simple collection of scripts to try and apply the recommended/typical Prometheus stack in a "generic" Kubernetes cluster.  Use at your own risk.

## What you should read

The actual project worth reading is [the kube-prometheus repo](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus)
