## To-Dos for Proxmox

Things I want to get around to implementing or further research.

- [ ] [Linstor](https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#about) and using it in [Proxmox as a distributed storage device](https://linbit.com/blog/linstor-setup-proxmox-ve-volumes/)
- [ ] [Automated Installation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Automated_Installation)
- [ ] [OctoDNS for declarative DNS](https://octodns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [ ] [Tinkerbell for bare metal](https://tinkerbell.org)
- [ ] [Wake on LAN for hosts](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/wake-on-lan-on-pve.124785/). I have configured the BIOS and the NIC, but need to keep trying to get it to work. Here is a [useful link to troubleshoot the packets](https://superuser.com/questions/870613/listen-for-wakeonlan-request).
- [ ] [Proxmox Hookscripts (especially for Plex LXC)](https://github.com/CurtisBlumer/ProxmoxVE-hookscripts)
